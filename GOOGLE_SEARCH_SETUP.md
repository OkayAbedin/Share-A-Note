# Google Search Console Setup Guide

This guide will help you index your Share-A-Note application in Google Search and monitor its SEO performance.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:
- A Google account
- Your website deployed and accessible (e.g., on Vercel)
- Access to your domain's DNS settings (if using a custom domain)

## Step 1: Add Your Site to Google Search Console

1. **Go to Google Search Console**
   - Visit [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/)
   - Sign in with your Google account

2. **Add a Property**
   - Click "Add Property"
   - Choose "URL prefix" and enter your full website URL (e.g., `https://shareanote.vercel.app`)
   - Click "Continue"

## Step 2: Verify Ownership

Choose one of the following verification methods:

### Method 1: HTML File Upload (Recommended for Vercel)
1. Download the HTML verification file from Google Search Console
2. Upload it to your `public/` folder in your Next.js project
3. Deploy your changes
4. Click "Verify" in Google Search Console

### Method 2: HTML Meta Tag
1. Copy the meta tag provided by Google Search Console
2. Add it to your `layout.tsx` file in the `<head>` section
3. Deploy your changes
4. Click "Verify" in Google Search Console

### Method 3: DNS Record (For Custom Domains)
1. Copy the TXT record provided by Google Search Console
2. Add it to your domain's DNS settings
3. Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours)
4. Click "Verify" in Google Search Console

## Step 3: Submit Your Sitemap

1. **In Google Search Console**, go to "Sitemaps" in the left sidebar
2. **Enter your sitemap URL**: `https://yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml`
3. **Click "Submit"**

Your sitemap is automatically generated at `/sitemap.xml` and includes:
- Homepage (/)
- About page (/about)
- Privacy policy (/privacy)
- Terms of service (/terms)

## Step 4: Request Indexing for Important Pages

1. **Use the URL Inspection tool**:
   - Enter your homepage URL
   - Click "Request Indexing" if the page isn't indexed yet
   - Repeat for other important pages (about, privacy, terms)

## Step 5: Monitor Performance

### Coverage Report
- Check for any indexing issues
- Monitor which pages are successfully indexed

### Performance Report
- Track search queries bringing users to your site
- Monitor click-through rates and impressions

### Enhancements
- Check for mobile usability issues
- Monitor Core Web Vitals

## Step 6: Optimize for Better Indexing

### Content Optimization
- Ensure each page has unique, descriptive titles
- Write compelling meta descriptions
- Use proper heading structure (H1, H2, H3)
- Add relevant keywords naturally

### Technical SEO
- Ensure fast loading times
- Make your site mobile-friendly
- Use HTTPS (enabled by default on Vercel)
- Implement structured data (already included)

## Step 7: Additional SEO Tools

2. Add the tracking code to your Next.js app
3. Link it with Google Search Console for more insights

### Bing Webmaster Tools
1. Visit [Bing Webmaster Tools](https://www.bing.com/webmasters)
2. Add your site
3. Submit your sitemap there as well

## What to Expect

- **Initial indexing**: Can take 1-7 days for new sites

- **Sitemap processing**: Usually processed within 24-48 hours

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Sitemap not found**: Ensure your site is deployed and accessible
2. **Pages not indexing**: Check for robots.txt issues or noindex tags
3. **Verification failed**: Double-check the verification method and wait a few minutes

### Environment Variables
Make sure to set your production URL in your environment variables:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

## Next Steps
